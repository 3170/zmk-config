# zmk-config

This is the configuration of my wireless 'Untitled' Lily58 / Sofle clone keyboard by https://github.com/AnthonyAmanse/untitled-keyboard/ .

Built with a nice! nanoV2 and without screen.

Also used https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config for embedding german/unicode letter support.
